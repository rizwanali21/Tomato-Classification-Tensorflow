# Tomato-Classification-Tensorflow
A project for classifying the different images of tomatoes. It is trained on a dataset from kaggle (link provided below). A tensforflow sequentional model which simply classifies tomatoes into 9 given categories. Dataset is divided into a train and test with a specific ratio to get the desired output.

## Dataset
